Yes, that's an excellent description for your repository. It's concise, informative, and gives visitors a clear understanding of what the project is and how it works.

Here is a slightly refined version you can use directly. I've added a section for the project's background to give it more context and a call to action at the end.

Project Description

A Python-based Interpreter for a Subset of Standard ML ðŸ’»

This repository hosts a simple interpreter for a subset of the Standard ML (SML) programming language, built from scratch in Python. The project serves as a practical demonstration of core compiler design principles, including lexical analysis, parsing, and semantic evaluation.

The interpreter supports:

    Lexical Analysis: Tokenization of raw source code.

    Parsing: Construction of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the token stream.

    Arithmetic & Boolean Expressions: Handles numbers, boolean values, and standard binary (+, -, *, /, =, <=, <) and unary (~, not) operations.

    Variable Bindings: Includes support for the let...in...end construct for variable definitions.

    Visitor Pattern: The final architecture utilizes the Visitor design pattern for clean and extensible code, allowing for different traversals of the AST, such as evaluation and static analysis (e.g., checking for undefined variables).

This project was developed through a series of incremental virtual programming lab exercises. Each new feature built upon the last, culminating in this final, organized, and functional interpreter.

If you're interested in compiler design or the SML language, feel free to explore the code!
